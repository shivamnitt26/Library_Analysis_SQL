# Library_Analysis_SQL
**Database**: `library_db`

This project involves developing a SQL-based solution for managing data within a library context. It includes designing relational tables, performing CRUD operations, and executing advanced queries. The objective is to demonstrate strong skills in database design, data manipulation, and query optimization in a real-world library scenario.

---

## **Objectives**

1. **Design and Populate the Library Database**: Create and fill tables related to branches, employees, members, books, issue records, and return records.
2. **Perform CRUD Operations**: Execute Create, Read, Update, and Delete actions on library data.
3. **Leverage CTAS**: Use *Create Table As Select* to generate new tables from query outputs.
4. **Implement Advanced SQL Queries**: Craft complex queries for in-depth data analysis and retrieval.


1. **DATABASE SETUP**

- **Database Creation**: Created a database named `library_db`.
- **Table Creation**: Created tables for branches, employees, members, books, issued status, and return status. Each table includes relevant columns and relationships.

```sql
CREATE DATABASE library_db;

DROP TABLE IF EXISTS branch;
CREATE TABLE branch
(
            branch_id VARCHAR(10) PRIMARY KEY,
            manager_id VARCHAR(10),
            branch_address VARCHAR(30),
            contact_no VARCHAR(15)
);


-- Create table "Employee"
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS employees;
CREATE TABLE employees
(
            emp_id VARCHAR(10) PRIMARY KEY,
            emp_name VARCHAR(30),
            position VARCHAR(30),
            salary DECIMAL(10,2),

            issued_id VARCHAR(30),
            return_book_name VARCHAR(80),
            return_date DATE,
            return_book_isbn VARCHAR(50),
            FOREIGN KEY (return_book_isbn) REFERENCES books(isbn)
);

```

### 2. CRUD Operations

- **Create**: Inserted sample records into the `books` table.
- **Read**: Retrieved and displayed data from various tables.
- **Update**: Updated records in the `employees` table.
- **Delete**: Removed records from the `members` table as needed.

**Task 1. Create a New Book Record**
-- "978-1-60129-456-2', 'To Kill a Mockingbird', 'Classic', 6.00, 'yes', 'Harper Lee', 'J.B. Lippincott & Co.')"
```sql
INSERT INTO books(isbn, book_title, category, rental_price, status, author, publisher)
VALUES('978-1-60129-456-2', 'To Kill a Mockingbird', 'Classic', 6.00, 'yes', 'Harper Lee', 'J.B. Lippincott & Co.');
SELECT * FROM books;
```
**Task 2: Update an Existing Member's Address**

```sql
UPDATE members
SET member_address = '125 Oak St'
WHERE member_id = '620015 Trichy';
```
**Task 3: Delete a Record from the Issued Status Table**
-- Objective: Delete the record with issued_id = 'IS121' from the issued_status table.
```sql
SET SQL_SAFE_UPDATES = 0;
 DELETE FROM issued_status 
 WHERE issued_id = "IS121";
```
**Task 4: Retrieve All Books Issued by a Specific Employee**
-- Objective: Select all books issued by the employee with emp_id = 'E101'.
```sql
SELECT * FROM issued_status
WHERE issued_emp_id = 'E101'
```
**Task 5: List Members Who Have Issued More Than One Book**
-- Objective: Use GROUP BY to find members who have issued more than one book.

```sql
SELECT
    issued_emp_id,
    COUNT(*)
FROM issued_status
GROUP BY issued_emp_id
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1
```
### 3. CTAS (Create Table As Select)

- **Task 6: Create Summary Tables**: Used CTAS to generate new tables based on query results - each book and total book_issued_cnt**

```sql
CREATE TABLE book_issued_cnt AS
SELECT b.isbn, b.book_title, COUNT(ist.issued_id) AS issue_count
FROM issued_status as ist
JOIN books as b
ON ist.issued_book_isbn = b.isbn
GROUP BY b.isbn, b.book_title;
```
### 4. Data Analysis & Findings

The following SQL queries were used to address specific questions:

Task 7. **Retrieve All Books in a Specific Category**:

```sql
SELECT * FROM books
WHERE category = 'Classic';
```

8. **Task 8: Find Total Rental Income by Category**:

```sql
SELECT 
    b.category,
    SUM(b.rental_price),
    COUNT(*)
FROM 
issued_status as ist
JOIN
books as b
ON b.isbn = ist.issued_book_isbn
GROUP BY 1
```
Task 9. **Create a Table of Books with Rental Price Above a Certain Threshold**:
```sql
CREATE TABLE expensive_books AS
SELECT * FROM books
WHERE rental_price > 7.00;
```
Task 10: **Retrieve the List of Books Not Yet Returned**
```sql
SELECT * FROM issued_status as ist
LEFT JOIN
return_status as rs
ON rs.issued_id = ist.issued_id
WHERE rs.return_id IS NULL;
```
**Task 11: Branch Performance Report**  
Create a query that generates a performance report for each branch, showing the number of books issued, the number of books returned, and the total revenue generated from book rentals.

```sql
CREATE TABLE branch_reports
AS
SELECT 
    b.branch_id,
    b.manager_id,
    COUNT(ist.issued_id) as number_book_issued,
    COUNT(rs.return_id) as number_of_book_return,
    SUM(bk.rental_price) as total_revenue
FROM issued_status as ist
JOIN 
employees as e
ON e.emp_id = ist.issued_emp_id
JOIN
branch as b
ON e.branch_id = b.branch_id
LEFT JOIN
return_status as rs
ON rs.issued_id = ist.issued_id
JOIN 
books as bk
ON ist.issued_book_isbn = bk.isbn
GROUP BY 1, 2;

SELECT * FROM branch_reports;
```
**Task 12: Find Employees with the Most Book Issues Processed**  
Write a query to find the top 3 employees who have processed the most book issues. Display the employee name, number of books processed, and their branch.

```sql
SELECT 
    e.emp_name,
    b.*,
    COUNT(ist.issued_id) as no_book_issued
FROM issued_status as ist
JOIN
employees as e
ON e.emp_id = ist.issued_emp_id
JOIN
branch as b
ON e.branch_id = b.branch_id
GROUP BY 1, 2
```
**Task 13: Stored Procedure**
Objective:
Create a stored procedure to manage the status of books in a library system.
Description:
Write a stored procedure that updates the status of a book in the library based on its issuance. The procedure should function as follows:
The stored procedure should take the book_id as an input parameter.
The procedure should first check if the book is available (status = 'yes').
If the book is available, it should be issued, and the status in the books table should be updated to 'no'.
If the book is not available (status = 'no'), the procedure should return an error message indicating that the book is currently not available.

```sql

DELIMITER $$

CREATE PROCEDURE issue_book(
    IN p_issued_id VARCHAR(10),
    IN p_issued_member_id VARCHAR(30),
    IN p_issued_book_isbn VARCHAR(30),
    IN p_issued_emp_id VARCHAR(10)
)
BEGIN
    DECLARE v_status VARCHAR(10);

    -- Get the book status
    SELECT status INTO v_status
    FROM books
    WHERE isbn = p_issued_book_isbn;

    -- Check if the book is available
    IF v_status = 'yes' THEN

        -- Insert issue record
        INSERT INTO issued_status(
            issued_id,
            issued_member_id,
            issued_date,
            issued_book_isbn,
            issued_emp_id
        ) VALUES (
            p_issued_id,
            p_issued_member_id,
            CURDATE(),
            p_issued_book_isbn,
            p_issued_emp_id
        );

        -- Update book status to 'no'
        UPDATE books
        SET status = 'no'
        WHERE isbn = p_issued_book_isbn;

        -- Optional: message (visible only in client tools like Workbench)
        SELECT CONCAT('Book records added successfully for book isbn : ', p_issued_book_isbn) AS message;

    ELSE
        SELECT CONCAT('Sorry, the book is unavailable. Book ISBN: ', p_issued_book_isbn) AS message;
    END IF;
END$$

DELIMITER ;

# Testing the function
CALL issue_book('IS155', 'C108', '978-0-553-29698-2', 'E104');
CALL issue_book('IS156', 'C108', '978-0-375-41398-8', 'E104');

SELECT * FROM books
